This is a 1-player Boggle simulator. The 16-dice are "rolled" and randomly positioned on a 4x4 grid. The player types words that appear in the grid, pressing ENTER to seperate, and ends the game by typing X. A review of the words that were typed along with their respective scores is printed, followed by a final score.

Scoring:

     5           2
     6           3
